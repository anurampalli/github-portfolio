          Let me tell you two stories. Stick around---otherwise, you will miss
          out (More like I'll miss the chance to rack up the audience engagement
          I desperately crave. Don't let me down!)
        </p>

        <h2>The Padlock Principle</h2>
        <p>
          Remember when your mother would turn the key in the padlock and then
          give it a little tug to make sure it was truly locked? And sometimes,
          she delegated that weighty responsibility to you---who, at the time,
          didn't know why, but still complied, pulling the padlock yourself,
          even though you'd already turned the key, grumbled about not trusting
          the process, even making jokes about mum. Ah, kids these days! Always
          asking "why, why, why"
        </p>

        <p>
          Total digress from the reminisce: Couple of weeks ago, I observed a
          small child at Booran Reserve. Her dad told her to be careful (she had
          a scooter and was standing on top of that hill thingy with the rope
          and slope and slide and all those contraptions) and she, with the
          innocent (or is it?), relentless logic of a four-year-old, looked at
          him and asked, "Why?" "Why?" "Why?" We, never asked why! We did what
          we were told!!! Ahem!
        </p>

        <h2>The Home Intrusion Testers</h2>
        <p>
          Now this one is a story---pinkie promise. My internet provider offers
          that delightful feature called "parental controls." In my naïveté, I
          logged into the router, set up homegrown restrictions, and thought I'd
          achieved technical nirvana. My seven-year-old cracked it in three
          days. Turns out, the secret to hacking parental controls is
          persistence: just hammer the connection until the gates (temporarily)
          open.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's a twist, though! I discovered another layer, a "pause" button
          deep in the control settings (It wasn't deep at all. I discovered it
          late). Victory! (For a week.) Then---deja vu---my offspring
          brute-forced their way back online again. At this point, that control
          was toast. Not to be outwitted, I deleted it, made another, and paused
          it. And, for one glorious night, it worked---mostly because exhaustion
          had set in on both sides of this cyberwar.
        </p>

        <p>Did I hide the remote? Absolutely. Am I proud? Also, absolutely.</p>

        <h2>ACLs: The Digital Padlock</h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >I bet you know why your mum tugged at that padlock. Whaaaat? You
            don't? its to make sure the lock isn't broken, silly! We don't live
            in a "appearance of lock is a deterrence" world anymore. We live in
            a "brute force until you break it" world.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          This delightful, and quite possibly endless "game of router" made me
          reflect on Access Control Lists (ACLs).
        </p>

        <p>
          Parental controls are just padlocks in digital form: the illusion of
          security until someone figures out the sequence.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently obsessed with logging ACL attempts---maybe out of
          professional interest, maybe just to keep the spirit of my mother's
          padlock wisdom alive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Debugging ACLs via [System Security → Debugging → Debug Security
          Rules] makes my Personal Developer Instance (PDI) crawl like a
          tortoise after a nap. So, my latest passion project is building an ACL
          logging page---lightweight enough to let the instance breathe, but
          robust enough for a responsible user to detect suspicious, repeat
          access attempts, say, to something spicy like a "Custom Confidential
          Document Table."
        </p>

        <h2>My Ingenious (and Sometimes Futile) Attempts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Script Include: Logging all attempts to a custom table...result,
            slow ACL performance (cue dramatic sigh).
          </li>
          <li>Direct GlideRecord update: Faster? Nope. Slows it down.</li>
          <li>
            Triggering an event with gs.eventQueue(): Surely, this will work?
            Spoiler---it doesn't trigger if the ACL blocks access (which,
            incidentally, is exactly what I need to catch).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          I am like a dog with a bone, but I'm ready to call it quits soon.
          Maybe one more day. Two at the most. Then, I'm waving the white flag
          and going back to the ServiceNow University course I was in the middle
          of before this wild goose chase began.
