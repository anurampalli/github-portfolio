      <h1>My First Hacktoberfest: Scared, Stumbling, and So Proud</h1>

        <p>
          Signing up for my first Hacktoberfest was completely intimidating. It
          felt like walking into this massive, bustling party where everyone
          already knew each other and even had a secret handshake. I was
          genuinely scared to open a Pull Request because I didn't know what a
          "good" or "reasonable" contribution even looked like. I wasn‚Äôt going
          to break anything on the main repository, but what if my idea was
          foolish? (In retrospect: everyone was so kind, and most of my ideas
          weren't foolish!)
        </p>

        <p>
          I checked out some code and some hack-for-good ideas and took a lot of
          deep breaths. Reading through accepted PRs and then finally just
          messing around with some code I already had is when it all finally
          started to click. That initial fear quickly morphed into this
          <i>exciting</i>, <i>empowering</i> feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            Hey! Did you ever feel like ChatGPT is a he and Gemini is a She? But
            I digress!
          </i>
        </p>
        <h2>The Final Tally</h2>
        <p>
          I ended up with 7 contributions! All of them are accepted and merged,
          which is huge.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a quick look at where I focused my energy:</p>

        <ul class="work__list">
          <li>
            <strong>code-snippets:</strong> This included
            <b>Domain Separation</b> (<i
              >It isn‚Äôt hard at all. I did it in a day. Just took me a beat to
              think of submitting it for hacktoberfest</i
            >) and <b>Transform Map</b> best practices (so others don't have to
            stumble around like I did), making sure they had crystal-clear
            READMEs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hack4Good-Idea-Submission:</strong> This was about purpose.
            I tried to write some genuinely meaningful tech-for-good project
            ideas, around child wellness (this is particularly close to home)
            and accessibility, hoping to inspire something real.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ActionPack:</strong> My goal here was to save fellow
            ServiceNow developers some pain, but for the second action I
            submitted, I got whimsical. I contributed reusable automation
            scripts and documentation to help streamline common, repetitive
            workflow steps. I got one idea from a question asked on the
            community and another one, I was just mucking about and thought,
            ‚ÄúHey! An email will be cool‚Äù.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Real Lesson</h2>
        <p>
          I thought Hacktoberfest was just about writing code [<i
            >yes, I hear myself. Low-code is code too, you know</i
          >
          üòâ], but I learned it's so much more about the process. I learned how
          to write a descriptive PR that a maintainer can actually review
          without wanting to pull their hair out. I learned the little nuances
          of using markdown to make documentation readable. Most importantly, I
          learned how to collaborate‚Äîtaking feedback and how rewarding it is to
          contribute to something bigger.
        </p>

        <p>
          I‚Äôm genuinely proud of how much I learned this year. I came in scared,
          and I‚Äôm leaving feeling like a real part of the ServiceNow community.
          Next year, I'm coming back with more confidence and, hopefully, more
          than seven accepted PRs under my belt! üòÑ
        </p>

        <p>
          A huge thanks to all the maintainers who were kind enough to guide and
          cheer on a wide-eyed first-timer like me. They made this whole journey
          so much more rewarding!

          PS: Re-reading it before posting, I feel like (there I go again), it
          goes ‚Äì me, myself and I. I hope it isn‚Äôt jarring.
