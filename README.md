## About Me

I am on an exciting journey as a ServiceNow Developer, returning to the workforce with a strong foundation in ITSM, integrations, and Agile methodologies. Over the years, I have delivered solutions at major organizations including Cognizant, Wipro, and FDM Group. During my career break, I earned certifications including PMP and became a certified Yoga teacher while contributing to NGO work, which enriched my leadership and interpersonal skills.

I am passionate about low-code/no-code platforms and leveraging the power of ServiceNow to build secure, scalable, and efficient business solutions. I thrive on solving complex problems with elegant technical solutions and collaborating with teams to drive positive digital transformation.
